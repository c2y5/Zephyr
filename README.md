# Proof of Work Browser Verification

Demo: https://zephyr.amsky.xyz

This project is a proof-of-concept implementation of a Proof of Work (PoW) system for browser verification.

The goal is to demonstrate how a simple computational challenge can be used to protect web resources from bots and automated abuse.

## How it works

1.  A user visits a protected page.
2.  The browser is presented with a computational challenge.
3.  JavaScript on the page solves the challenge and submits the solution.
4.  The server verifies the solution and grants access.

This is a demonstration and not intended for production use without further development.
